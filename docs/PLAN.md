# Theme Park native macOS plan

Target: the user's GOG `theme_park_enUS_1_0_33010.pkg`, recompiled into native
Apple Silicon code. This initial session starts the project; a working game is
not claimed. Ground rules: [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## Confirmed input survey

The package is 104,934,252 bytes, SHA-256
`942da3010a657c07621eb19c6f2dacbb71ce6f06c07f62914cb8f422e1305650`.
It contains a DOS release wrapped for Mac: `GAME/MAIN.EXE`, `GAME/INTRO.EXE`,
`CONFIG/MAIN.EXE`, DOS4GW and HMI audio-driver files. The game executables are
32-bit LE images behind MZ stubs, with their LE headers at file offset 0x28b8.
No Windows DLL import layer is present in these three images.

| Image | Bytes | Entry at LE object bases | Internal offset fixups | Function candidates | Static code-byte coverage |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| GAME/MAIN.EXE | 841,223 | 0x7e2cc | 19,746 | 1,812 | 97.53% |
| GAME/INTRO.EXE | 179,303 | 0x11554 | 3,479 | 518 | 86.67% |
| CONFIG/MAIN.EXE | 90,758 | 0x15450 | 2,007 | 300 | 90.06% |

All recorded fixups in these images are internal 32-bit offset fixups. The LE
reader maps initialized pages and zero-filled tails, and applies these fixups.
Offsets may represent negative biases modulo 2^32; rejecting every offset beyond
an object's size incorrectly rejects the actual main executable. This address
arithmetic now has a synthetic regression test.

Main has three objects: code at 0x10000 (0x84deb bytes), writable storage at
0xa0000 (0x110), and data/BSS/stack at 0xb0000 (0x32340). These are analysis
addresses from the file, not a verified DPMI process layout or physical VGA map.

**Coverage is provisional.** The survey starts from the entry and relocation
references into code, then follows direct control flow. Some references may be
jump-table entries or embedded data. Suspicious disassemblies exist; a high
byte-coverage number does not validate all those instruction boundaries. Main's
first pass has 153,273 decoded instructions, 96 indirect-call sites and 57
indirect jumps. DOS/DPMI interrupts and port I/O are visible, but the exact set of
services required by live startup still needs a dynamic trace. Do not implement
every apparent service found in a speculative decode.

## Phases

| Phase | Deliverable / expected effect | State | Effort and confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Owned input pins, scratch extraction, ground rules and source-only project | Done locally | Small; high |
| 1 | Bounded LE mapping/fixups, executable census | Initial version done | Small for observed files; medium for arbitrary LE files |
| 2 | ARM64 routine proofs using the shared lifter | Two integer/memory slices pass | Small initial proof; broad CPU coverage still needed |
| 3 | Verified startup analysis and differential trace to first DOS service | Next | Medium; startup ABI and segment state unverified |
| 4 | DOS/DPMI services: memory, process environment, files, time and callbacks | Not started | Large; high confidence this replaces the Win32 layer |
| 5 | Framebuffer/palette presentation through a background Metal host, then menus | Not started | Medium–large; VGA/VESA access strategy (verify) |
| 6 | Native input and simulation pacing; new park, build operations, save/load | Not started | Large integration phase; game-loop boundaries (verify) |
| 7 | Intro playback and HMI audio through native output | Not started | Large/uncertain; driver ABI and music formats (verify) |
| 8 | Soak, original-behavior comparisons, launcher and packaging | Not started | After playable milestone; no installation authorized yet |

The shared lifter currently classifies `int`, port I/O and several DOS-era
instructions as unsupported Windows-path instructions. They need deliberate DOS
service boundaries, not success stubs or an embedded CPU interpreter. Do not
claim the game works because the native slice library loads.

## Verification and limits

- Seven synthetic LE tests pass, including every truncated prefix of the fixture,
  invalid bounds/objects, BSS, source lists, relative relocations, negative target
  bias and explicit pending selector fixups. No game bytes are in the fixtures.
- Fresh extraction was reproduced after preserving the first extraction under
  `work/*-first-inspection`; package scripts were not executed.
- All three actual executable images parse with zero pending offset fixups.
- Native proof: 0x28656 updates a 16-bit field; 0x87790 sign-extends four 16-bit
  inputs, stores them and their pairwise sums. These are behavior descriptions,
  not recovered original symbol names. Each ran 1,000 cases including integer
  boundaries and deterministic random values, **2,000 cases, zero mismatches**.
- Comparison covers all eight integer registers, defined arithmetic flags and
  DF, both writable LE objects, scratch memory and stack. The generated code is
  an ARM64 Mach-O library; `otool -L` shows only libSystem as a dependency.
- Both sides use the new LE loader's relocated bytes. This proves the selected
  lifted instruction behavior under that layout, not independent equivalence
  of the loader to DOS4GW. Startup/segment/bootstrap equivalence is still needed.
- No x87, OS call, hardware I/O, framebuffer, audio, whole-game startup, game
  loop or save compatibility has been verified. No game window was opened.

Evidence (local/ignored): `work/main-survey.json`, `work/intro-survey.json`,
`work/config-survey.json`, `work/native-proof/result.json`,
`work/native-proof/proof.dylib`, `work/check.log`.

## Next concrete step

Trace the entry jump at 0x7e2cc into startup (0x7e346), establish the DOS4GW
register/segment/PSP/environment contract, and compare a bounded startup prefix
against the original x86 up to the first DOS/DPMI boundary. Add DOS service
implementations only as that trace requires them. Extend instruction-form and
routine tests before attempting the first framebuffer.

## Done so far

- 2026-10-16 (Codex): located and inspected the owned package; read the requested
  guide and reference ports. Established that this is a DOS/LE target. Added a
  bounded LE reader, synthetic tests, reproducible pinned extraction and static
  surveys. Reused the pinned Freedom Force lifter/header implementation in a
  local proof; two Theme Park routines now execute as ARM64 and pass 2,000
  original-vs-native cases. Existing projects and Downloads were not modified.
  No remote repository, public upload, installed app, launcher or release was
  created. Remaining runtime work is listed above.
